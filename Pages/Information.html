                    <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
                        It affects how we think, feel, act, and handle stress in our daily lives.
                        Mental health also influences how we make decisions, build relationships,
                        and cope with challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mental health, like physical health, changes over time and can be influenced 
                        by life experiences, stress, and other factors. Everyone experiences ups and 
                        downs, and feeling happy all the time doesn’t necessarily mean you have good 
                        mental health. Maintaining it involves managing your emotions, coping with 
                        challenges, and building habits that support your well-being. Good mental 
                        health helps you think clearly, make decisions, and maintain healthy relationships.

                <div class="info-block">
                    <h2>Why is Mental Health important?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mental health is a vital part of our overall well-being, shaping how we think, 
                        feel, and act each day. Because it’s dynamic, even subtle changes can affect 
                        our motivation, focus, and ability to handle challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When mental health is strong, we feel more resilient, productive, and able to 
                        nurture positive relationships. Conversely, poor mental health can make daily 
                        tasks overwhelming, reduce efficiency, and strain social connections. Paying 
                        attention to mental well-being helps us cope better, make clearer decisions, 
                        and enjoy life more fully.

                    <h2>Common Mental Health Conditions & Signs of Struggles</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mental health conditions are more common than many people realize, and 
                        understanding them is the first step toward support and recovery. Some 
                        of the most common conditions include anxiety, depression, stress-related 
                        disorders, and burnout.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Signs that someone may be struggling with their mental health include:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Emotional changes:</b>
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Feeling sad, anxious, or overwhelmed for extended periods of time</li>
                        <li>Losing interest or enjoyment in activities they once loved</li>
                        
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        <b>Behavioural changes:</b>
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
                        <li>Withdrawing from friends, family, or social activities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        <b>Physical changes:</b>
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Changes in sleep patterns or appetite</li>
                        <li>Feeling tired or emotionally drained most of the time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        These signs are not a sign of weakness. They indicate that a person 
                        may need support, understanding, or professional help. Recognizing 
                        and addressing them early can greatly improve well-being.
