                    <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
                        It affects how we think, feel, act, and handle stress in our daily lives.
                        Mental health also influences how we make decisions, build relationships,
                        and cope with challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everyone has mental health, just like physical health. It can change over time
                        and may be affected by life experiences, stress, or personal situations.
                        Having good mental health does not mean feeling happy all the time — it means
                        being able to manage emotions and adapt to life.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-block">
                    <h2>Why is Mental Health important?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mental health is important because it affects every part of our lives.
                        When our mental health is in a good state, we are better able to learn,
                        work, communicate, and enjoy daily activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poor mental health can make everyday tasks feel overwhelming and may
                        impact relationships, school, or work. Taking care of mental health
                        helps improve overall well-being and allows people to cope better
                        with challenges and changes in life.

                    <h2>Common Mental Health Conditions & Signs of Struggles</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mental health conditions are more common than many people realize.
                        Some common conditions include anxiety, depression, stress-related
                        disorders, and burnout.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Someone who is struggling with their mental health might experience:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Feeling sad, anxious, or overwhelmed for long periods of time</li>
                        <li>Losing interest in activities they once enjoyed</li>
                        <li>Changes in sleep patterns or appetite</li>
                        <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
                        <li>Withdrawing from friends, family, or social activities</li>
                        <li>Feeling tired or emotionally drained most of the time</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Experiencing these signs does not mean someone is weak.
                        It simply means they may need understanding, support or help.
                    </p>
