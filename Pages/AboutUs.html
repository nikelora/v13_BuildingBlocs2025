        <h1><b>About Us - SerenityHub</b></h1>
        <p>At SerenityHub, we believe that everyone deserves a safe space to understand, express, and care for their mental well-being. 
            Created as part of a hackathon project, SerenityHub was built with a meaningful purpose: to make mental health education, 
            support, and resources more accessible for everyone.

        <br>Many people find it difficult to open up about their struggles, even with those they trust. Yet the need to talk, 
        learn and feel understood remains. Serenity Hub provides a safe, secure, and inclusive environment where anyone can seek 
        guidance without fear or judgment - whether you’re looking for someone to talk to, ways to calm down, or reliable 
        information about your mental health.</p>

        <h2><b>Our Purpose</b></h2>
        <p>SerenityHub strives to:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Promote mental health awareness</b> through easy-to-understand, reliable educational content.</li>
                <li><b>Support emotional well-being</b> with calming videos, grounding techniques, and self-soothing tips.</li>
                <li><b>Connect users with real support</b> by helping them locate nearby clinics, helplines, and mental health services.</li>
                <li><b>Create a judgment-free space</b> where people can reflect, breathe, and find comfort.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            It's okay to not be okay.
            <br>
            It's okay to feel overwhelmed or uncertain about your mental health.
            <br>
            <b>SerenityHub is here to help you to navigate that journey.</b>
